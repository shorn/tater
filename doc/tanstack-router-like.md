## Asynchronous, public, searchable discussion board

Lots of projects have nothing except Discord or Twitter.

tanstack-router use GitHub discussions.  
It's proprietary, but at least it's fairly public, not sure if it can be 
archived but that's not too big of a deal.
You need a GitHub account to post, but you can still do that with just an email
(at this point).

The other "synchronous" community option is Discord, you can create an account
easily but won't be able to post without giving your phone number. Then, once
Discord decides you're "suspicious" they will force you to provide phone number
even to view discussions.
I dislike Discord but all the other viable options are equally bad 
(Slack, Zoom, etc.)
